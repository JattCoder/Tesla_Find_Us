Steps for project
To find charging locations near me, using zip, city, state
* Get all locations of superchargers from superchargers.info

To get geo cordinates for me and destination use geocoder gem

To get superchargers list and information from tesla website
* loop thru route chargers
* get names and duration of charging at each charger and trip duration 

To get superchargers 
* Scrape stops names and time to charge from tesla website
* Use names to get locations info from superchargers.info

Use activerecord and sql to save cars and profiles






GeoCoder 
To get Coordinates
Coordinates = Geocoder.coordinates("address")
address = Geocoder.address([lat,long])




In order to find out best possible route
EXAMPLE:
car range = 200
total distance = 1000
using car range = 150 -- saving 50 as backup 
holdpoint = chargedid if charger passes less distance and within car range
if passes both tests -- total distance = distance left over and add chargerid to array

to check distance between point and car AND point and destination -- Geocoder

In order to find (driving time) -- total distance / average speed(70mph)

In order to find total route time -- driving time + ALLCHARGERS(calculate charging speed using supercharger power)
